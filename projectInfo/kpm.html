    <h2>More Information</h2>
    <br>
  	<p>Kindle Package Manager ("kpm") is the first freely available package manager for kindles.<br><br>
        It has inspired other projects such as <a href="https://github.com/polish-penguin-dev/kindleforge">KindleForge</a>, a graphical package manager, with its simplicity and ease of use.<br>
        kpm is purely written in 800 or so lines of C, 90% of which written by my own hand.<br>
        It has gathered so much attention that it even has it's own <a href="https://kpmwiki.vercel.app">wiki</a>, created by myself and <a href="https://github.com/crizmo">Kurizu</a><br><br>
        
    The code can be found <a href="https://github.com/gingrspacecadet/kpm">here.</a></p>
